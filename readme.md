# Weather Forecast

## Description

In this challenge I learned how to call an API to load the weather information in my webpage. I also learned how to set up and use an API key and followed the required URL syntax to get different kinds of API results. I used one URL to get the current weather, and another to get the forecast for the next 5 days.

My motivation was to feel comfortable calling API's and displaying the needed information in my webpage. I also wanted to keep practicing my javascript and css skills.

## Usage

Enter a city in the input area and click the search button. In the right side of the screen the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days will appear.
In the bottom left of the screen, buttons with the names of the searched cities will be displayed, and once clicked they will show again the information for the  city that was clicked.
